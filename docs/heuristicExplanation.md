This PR presents a heuristic evaluation of the AttenSys website, identifying key usability issues and providing actionable recommendations based on Nielsen Norman Group’s 10 Usability Heuristics.

### Visibility of System Status
*(The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.)*

- **Problem:** On the Home page at `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home#`, clicking the "Get Started" button (visible in the top banner area) redirects to `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course`, but there's no immediate feedback or loading indicator during the transition. Users might feel unsure if the click worked until the page loads. On `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course`, there's no confirmation message to clarify that the redirect was successful or related to the "Get Started" action. Similarly, on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer`, there's no clear feedback when interacting with elements or loading the page to indicate system status. The main navigation menu on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home#` (including options visible on desktop and within the hamburger menu on mobile) also lacks feedback when clicked, such as a highlight or loading indicator to show which section or page is active or loading.
- **Impact on Web Readers:** Screen reader users may not receive audio feedback during redirects or page loads, leaving them unaware of transitions or actions on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`, `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course`, or `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer`.
- **Recommendation with Airbnb Inspiration:** Improve feedback mechanisms on the Attensys website by adopting an approach similar to Airbnb's website at `https://www.airbnb.com`. For interactive elements like the "Get Started" button on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`, add a loading animation or spinner to show processing (visible to sighted users) during the redirect to `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course`. For the main navigation menu on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`, implement visual feedback like a subtle highlight, underline, or color change on the clicked menu item to indicate selection or active state, mirroring Airbnb's approach. For page transitions on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course` and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer`, include a brief confirmation message or title update to affirm the user's action. For web readers, ensure buttons and menu items have ARIA labels (e.g., "Redirecting to Course page" for the button, "Navigating to selected section" for menu items) and announce page load completion with focusable messages.
On `https://www.airbnb.com`, the main navigation menu (e.g., options like "Stays" or "Experiences" at the top) provides immediate visual feedback when clicked, such as a highlighted tab or a loading indicator during page transitions, ensuring users know the system recognized their action. Interactive buttons, like search or booking options, often show subtle animations or state changes (e.g., a button press effect or spinner) to confirm interaction. Additionally, after navigation or actions, Airbnb frequently updates the page with clear title changes or confirmation messages (e.g., "Search results loaded"), keeping users informed. Attensys can improve by adopting similar visual and auditory cues to confirm actions and transitions across all pages.

The UI presents call-to-action elements as buttons that currently lack clear distinctions between their default, hover, and active states, undermining the visual feedback needed for intuitive interactions.



### Consistency and Standards
*(Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.)*

- **Problem:** The design is mostly consistent across content on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`. However, on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course` and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer`, the visual style (e.g., header layout and background color) slightly differs from the Home page and from each other, which might confuse users about whether they are still on the same website. The footer design and content (e.g., branding or links) also vary slightly across the pages, with differences in layout or text, which can disrupt the sense of a unified site. On mobile view of the Home page, the navigation menu switches to a hamburger icon, reducing the visibility of options compared to desktop view. (Verified: Compared design of Home, Course, and Explorer pages; noted visual differences in headers and footers. Tested mobile view of Home page; menu collapses to hamburger icon.)
- **Recommendation:** Align the design of `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course` and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer` with `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home#` (e.g., same header and footer style and content). Ensure navigation menu and footer items have consistent labels across desktop and mobile views, with proper ARIA roles (e.g., "navigation" and "button" for hamburger menu, "contentinfo" for footer) to support web readers.

### Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
*(Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.)*

- **Problem:** On `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`, the page is long, and scrolling from the top to the bottom takes time. There is no quick way, like a button or shortcut, to go back to the top of the page or move faster between different parts of the content. On `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course` and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer`, going back to `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home` requires using the browser's back button, which is slower and less convenient than a direct link. The footer on all pages does not provide any quick navigation links or shortcuts to improve efficiency. (Verified: Scrolled full Home page; no shortcut buttons found for faster navigation. Confirmed no visible return link on Course and Explorer pages, including in footers.)
- **Impact on Web Readers:** Screen reader users often use keyboard shortcuts or quick links to move around long pages. Without such options, it takes longer to navigate `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`, especially to revisit earlier content.
- **Recommendation:** Add a "Back to Top" button on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home#`, visible after scrolling, to help users quickly return to the start. On `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course` and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer`, add a "Back to Home" link in the header, menu, or footer for fast navigation, accessible via keyboard.

### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
*(Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.)*

- **Problem:** On the Home page at `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home#`, the design is visually clean at first glance, but the content below the top banner, specifically sections with headings and descriptions such as "Sign Up", "Purchase with STRK", "Manage Your Courses", and "Verify Certificate", feels cluttered and hard to process quickly. The text for these sections (e.g., "Sign Up: Create an account using google account or email/password. Log in instantly or get a wallet auto-created if none exists. Whether you're a learner, or course creator, we have the courses & tools for you.") is presented in large blocks without sufficient visual breaks or hierarchy, making it less clear at first sight. The whitespace between these content blocks is uneven or insufficient, causing the sections to blend together rather than stand out as distinct features. On `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course`, the content is simpler but lacks visual hierarchy or spacing to guide users through key information.
- **Impact on Web Readers:** Long text blocks without clear breaks or proper headings are harder to process for screen reader users. Without a structured layout using HTML headings (H1, H2) or sufficient spacing announced via ARIA landmarks, users may lose track of content hierarchy across `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`.
Enhance the aesthetic and minimalist design of the Attensys website by restructuring content presentation, inspired by Udemy's approach at `https://www.udemy.com`. On `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home#`, break up the text-heavy sections like "Sign Up", "Purchase with STRK", "Manage Your Courses", and "Verify Certificate" into concise points or cards with clear headings, short descriptions, and sufficient whitespace between each block to make them visually distinct and easier to scan. Use icons or images next to each section (e.g., a user icon for "Sign Up") to provide visual cues, reducing textual overload. Improve whitespace by adding more padding or margins around content blocks to prevent them from blending together. Consider combining the content from `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home` and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course` into a single page, as Udemy does, where the home page includes both an overview of services and direct access to course-related actions (like browsing or signing up) without needing a separate redirect. 
On `https://www.udemy.com`, the home page design exemplifies Aesthetic and Minimalist Design by presenting key information in a clear, scannable format. Udemy's main page combines an overview of what the platform offers (e.g., learning opportunities, course categories) with direct calls to action (like "Browse Courses" or "Sign Up") on a single page, avoiding unnecessary redirects to separate pages for basic interactions. Content is organized into visually distinct sections with ample whitespace, bold headings (e.g., "Learn anything"), concise taglines, and supporting images or icons that break up text and guide user attention. For instance, promotional banners or featured courses use balanced spacing and minimal text to avoid overwhelming users, while interactive elements are clearly separated from descriptive content. In contrast.

### Help and Documentation
*(Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.)*

- **Problem:** On the Home page at `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`, there is a visible "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) section, which provides helpful information to address common user queries. However, while the FAQ section exists, there are still usability issues related to help and documentation. The navigation menu on desktop view does not include a direct "Contact" link or a prominently labeled "Help" link to quickly access support options beyond the FAQ. On mobile view, a "Contact" option appears in the hamburger menu, but it scrolls to the bottom of the page without providing explicit contact information (e.g., no visible email, phone number, or form) to directly reach support. The footer on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`, as well as on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course` and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer`, also lacks contact details, social media links, or additional help resources that are often expected for user support. 
- **Recommendation:** Enhance access to help resources by adding a direct "FAQ" or "Help" link in the main navigation menu on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home`, `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course`, and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer`, ensuring users can quickly jump to the Frequently Asked Questions section or a dedicated help page from any location. Include a "Contact Us" section or link, ideally in the footer or navigation menu of all pages.

## Final Thoughts on Footer and Overall Usability

Regarding the footer specifically, it is generally minimal and does not pose significant usability issues under most of Jakob Nielsen's heuristics, which is good for maintaining a clean design (as noted under Aesthetic and Minimalist Design). However, it misses an opportunity to enhance user support by lacking contact information or help links, which is a critical issue under Help and Documentation (heuristic 10). The footer could be improved by adding such elements to make the site more user-friendly.

Overall, I've focused this evaluation on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, only including those where specific issues were found on `https://www.attensys.xyz/Home#`, `https://www.attensys.xyz/Course`, and `https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer` (heuristics 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10). I've strictly used real elements and links observed on the website, avoiding assumptions or invented information. I've also considered usability for web reader users by addressing accessibility needs. Adding navigation tools like a "Back to Top" button, providing clear feedback on actions, breaking up text in content areas, and adding accessible contact options (especially in the footer) will improve usability for all users, including those using screen readers. These changes will make the site more professional and inclusive.

If any observations seem incorrect or unclear, please let me know, and I'll investigate further.

## Additional Thoughts on the Site

## During the evaluation of the Explorer page on the Attensys website (https://www.attensys.xyz/Explorer)
 a few specific usability concerns emerged that could impact the experience of users, particularly those who are not familiar with the platform's data or purpose. Addressing these issues can make the page more intuitive and accessible to a wider audience. The key points of feedback are as follows:

Clarity of the List and Data Columns: The current presentation of the list on the Explorer page lacks context for unexpert users. It is unclear what the list represents or what the individual data points signify. To improve comprehension, I recommend adding a brief introductory explanation at the top of the page or beside the list. This could include a short description of the list's purpose and a tooltip or legend explaining the meaning of each column or data type. This will help users quickly understand the information being displayed without needing prior knowledge.

Simplification of Date-Time Format: The date and time format used on the Explorer page, such as "Jun 10, 2025 16:38:47 4:38 PM," feels unnatural and redundant due to the repetition of the time. This can confuse users or make the interface appear cluttered. To enhance readability, I suggest simplifying the format to a single, clear representation, such as "Jun 10, 2025 4:38 PM." This aligns with common conventions and reduces visual noise, making the information easier to process.

By implementing these changes, the Explorer page can become more user-friendly, especially for those who are new to the platform. These recommendations aim to improve clarity and reduce potential confusion, ensuring that all users can navigate and interpret the content effectively.

## While evaluating the Course page on the Attensys website (https://www.attensys.xyz/Course)
I identified a couple of specific usability issues that could hinder the user experience. Addressing these concerns can make the page more functional and intuitive for users. The key points of feedback are as follows:

Non-Functional Filter Course Section: The filter functionality in the Course section does not appear to be working as intended. When attempting to use the filters, there is no visible response or change in the displayed content, which can frustrate users seeking to narrow down their options. I recommend troubleshooting and fixing the filter mechanism to ensure it operates smoothly. Additionally, providing visible feedback (e.g., a loading indicator or updated results) after applying filters would improve the user experience by aligning with the principle of visibility of system status.

Confusing Layout with Multiple Sections: The Course page currently features three distinct sections, which create confusion regarding their purpose and hierarchy. This fragmented layout can overwhelm users who expect a more streamlined presentation of content. In comparison, a platform like Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/) maintains a simpler structure on its main page with just two primary sections, making navigation and content discovery more intuitive. I suggest consolidating the content on the Course page into a single, unified section focused on displaying courses. This would reduce cognitive load and help users focus on exploring available courses without unnecessary distractions or confusion.

By addressing these issues, the Course page can become more user-friendly and aligned with common design practices seen on similar platforms. These recommendations aim to enhance functionality and simplify the layout, ensuring that users can interact with the page more effectively.

## During the evaluation of the Account Center page on the Attensys website (https://www.attensys.xyz/mycoursepage/0x3b3238c3720c6fac0006a95b0a7b0cb55a6d1099d717958267ba6f6a83aeb0e)
I identified specific usability issues related to accessibility and URL readability that could impact the user experience, particularly for new users. Addressing these concerns can make the page more intuitive and approachable. The key points of feedback are as follows:

Confusing Navigation Path to Access Account Center: The current navigation to reach the Account Center—via Main Menu > Courses > Account Center—feels unintuitive and cumbersome. This multi-step process, or "weird clicking," may not be immediately obvious to users, especially new ones who are unfamiliar with the website's structure. Additionally, it appears that this page may not be accessible at all to new users who have not yet created an account or enrolled in courses, as there is no clear entry point or guidance provided for them. To improve accessibility, I recommend adding a direct link to the Account Center in a more prominent location, such as the main navigation menu or a user profile icon, with clear labeling (e.g., "My Account" or "Dashboard"). Furthermore, for users who are not logged in or are new, the link could redirect to a login/registration page with a helpful message explaining how to access the Account Center after signing in. This aligns with the usability heuristic of user control and freedom, ensuring users can easily find and access key areas of the site.

Non-User-Friendly URL Structure: The URL for the Account Center page is excessively long and filled with technical characters (e.g., "0x3b3238c3720c6fac..."), making it neither readable nor memorable for users. This can create a sense of distrust or confusion, as users may perceive it as unprofessional or unclear. To address this, I suggest implementing a more user-friendly URL structure, such as "https://www.attensys.xyz/my-account" or "https://www.attensys.xyz/dashboard," which is both readable and aligned with common web conventions. If the current URL structure is necessary for technical reasons (e.g., user-specific identifiers), consider using URL rewriting or masking to present a cleaner version to users while maintaining backend functionality. This improvement would enhance the aesthetic and professional appearance of the site.

By implementing these changes, the Account Center page can become more accessible and user-friendly, particularly for new users who may struggle with navigation or feel alienated by technical URLs. These recommendations aim to streamline access and improve the overall perception of the website’s design, ensuring a smoother experience for all users.
